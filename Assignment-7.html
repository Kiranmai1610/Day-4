<h4>Definition and Usage</h4>
<p>The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.</p>

<p>The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.</p>

<p>By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:</p>

<p>An unvisited link is underlined and blue<br>
A visited link is underlined and purple<br>
An active link is underlined and red</p>
<h5>Tips and Notes</h5>
<p>Tip: If the <a> tag has no href attribute, it is only a placeholder for a hyperlink.</p>

<p>Tip: A linked page is normally displayed in the current browser window, unless you specify another target.</p>

<p>Tip: Use CSS to style links: CSS Links and CSS Buttons.</p>
